These are documents about how AdvScrabble was created. These include:

1- AdvScrabbleDocumentation.odt. It has an user story and the necesary requeriments.
2- DatabaseDiagram.mwb. It contains the M.E.R for the game.
3- UMLClassDiagram.dia. It is the diagram class for the entity class. 
4- AdvScrabbleMovie.fbr. It is a video which shows how to play the game.

Thanks for reading the documentation.
